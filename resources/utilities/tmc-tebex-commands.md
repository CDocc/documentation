# TMC Framework Tebex Command Integration

## Overview

The TMC Framework Tebex Command Integration provides custom server commands specifically designed for TMC Framework servers to issue donation rewards through Tebex. These commands allow server administrators to automatically deliver items, vehicles, helicopters, and boats directly to players using their Citizen ID.

{% hint style="info" %}
This utility features a centralized configuration system that makes customization easy and maintains consistency across all commands.
{% endhint %}

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration System

The script includes a comprehensive `Config` table at the top of `server.lua` that centralizes all settings:

### Garage Locations
```lua
Config.GarageLocations = {
    cars = 'legionsquare',      -- Default car storage garage
    helicopters = 'lsiagen',    -- Default helicopter storage garage
    boats = 'helitours'         -- Default boat storage garage
}
```

### Vehicle Types
```lua
Config.VehicleTypes = {
    car = 'vehicle',
    helicopter = 'aircraft',
    boat = 'boat'
}
```

### Notification Messages
```lua
Config.Notifications = {
    item = 'You received %s x %s as donation rewards',
    vehicle = 'You received a vehicle as a donation reward',
    helicopter = 'You received a helicopter as a donation reward',
    boat = 'You received a boat as a donation reward'
}
```

### Logging Configuration
```lua
Config.Logging = {
    source = 'tebex-commands',
    colors = {
        success = 'green',
        error = 'red',
        info = 'blue'
    },
    forceDiscord = true
}
```

{% hint style="success" %}
**Easy Customization**: All settings are centralized in the Config table. Simply modify these values to customize garage locations, notification messages, and logging preferences without editing the command code.
{% endhint %}

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Garage Locations

Modify the garage locations where vehicles are stored by editing the `Config.GarageLocations` table:

```lua
Config.GarageLocations = {
    cars = 'legionsquare',      -- Change to any valid garage name
    helicopters = 'lsiagen',    -- Change to any valid helicopter garage
    boats = 'helitours'         -- Change to any valid marina/boat garage
}
```

### Vehicle Type Configuration

Customize how vehicles are categorized in the database:

```lua
Config.VehicleTypes = {
    car = 'vehicle',      -- Database vehicle type for cars
    helicopter = 'aircraft',  -- Database vehicle type for helicopters
    boat = 'boat'         -- Database vehicle type for boats
}
```

### Notification Customization

Personalize the messages players receive when getting donation rewards:

```lua
Config.Notifications = {
    item = 'You received %s x %s as donation rewards',
    vehicle = 'You received a vehicle as a donation reward',
    helicopter = 'You received a helicopter as a donation reward',
    boat = 'You received a boat as a donation reward'
}
```

### Logging Settings

Configure how actions are logged:

```lua
Config.Logging = {
    source = 'tebex-commands',    -- Log source identifier
    colors = {
        success = 'green',        -- Success log color
        error = 'red',           -- Error log color
        info = 'blue'            -- Info log color
    },

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Commands Not Working
**Possible Causes:**
- Commands not run from server console
- Incorrect citizen ID format
- TMC Framework not properly configured

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you're using server console only
2. Verify citizen ID exists in TMC database
3. Check TMC Framework installation

#### Items Not Appearing
**Possible Causes:**
- Item name doesn't match server configuration
- Player inventory is full
- Database connection issues

**Solutions:**
1. Verify item names in TMC items table
2. Check player inventory space
3. Test database connectivity

#### Vehicle Not in Garage
**Possible Causes:**
- Vehicle model name incorrect
- Garage location not configured properly
- Database write failure
- Wrong `Config.GarageLocations` setting

**Solutions:**
1. Verify vehicle spawn names match your server
2. Check `Config.GarageLocations` settings match your garage system
3. Ensure garage names exist in your TMC Framework setup
4. Review database logs

### Configuration Issues

#### Wrong Garage Assignment
**Problem:** Vehicles appear in wrong garages
**Solution:** Check and update `Config.GarageLocations`:
```lua
Config.GarageLocations = {
    cars = 'your_car_garage_name',
    helicopters = 'your_heli_garage_name', 
    boats = 'your_boat_garage_name'
}
```

#### Notification Messages Not Showing
**Problem:** Players not receiving reward notifications
**Solution:** Verify `Config.Notifications` are properly configured:
```lua
Config.Notifications = {
    vehicle = 'Your custom vehicle message',
    -- etc...
}
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```lua
Config.Debug = true
```

This will provide detailed console output for all command executions.
